When I was a freshman at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, I was a member of the Public Affairs team for my Air Force ROTC detachment. This role required me to take on various responsibilities, from managing media and communications to planning social events. One of my most significant projects was directing an end-of-the-year video, which required extensive planning, teamwork, and dedication. Throughout the process, I worked closely with my peers to ensure everything ran smoothly, from conceptualizing the project to executing it successfully.
