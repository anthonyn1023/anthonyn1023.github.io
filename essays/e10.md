## Reflection on Typescript
TypeScript is more straightforward and beginner-friendly than Java. It combines the flexibility of JavaScript with added features like static typing, which helps catch errors early. Unlike Java, which can be wordy and require a lot of setup, TypeScript is more straightforward and focuses on getting things done with less effort.

TypeScript’s innovative features, like type inference, mean you don’t have to define everything manually—it figures a lot out for you. 

## Thought on the WODS
I really enjoy the WODs because they give a great opportunity to get hands-on practice with coding.

By working through a WOD, you can solve real problems, experiment with code, and  improve your understanding a lot faster. It’s also a great way to build confidence as you see your skills improve over time. The time constraint or focus of WODs can make them feel like a fun, productive workout for your brain.
